# GeneticTSP

This is my first attempt at creating Genetic Algorithms.
I'll be trying some stuff with the "Hello World" of Genetic Algorithms - Travelling Salesman Problem.

A prespecified number of cities will be generated with random (x,y) each in the range of (0,200). And a path between them will be optimized.
